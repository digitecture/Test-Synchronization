Energy savings can be as high as 42\\% electrical energy use over conventional VAV system \\cite{Jeong2003}\\ret\n\n\\subsection{Physical Characteristics of \\gls{hbs}}\n	\\subsubsection{Surface Vapor

humid air\\cite{Ahmed1998}.\\\\\n	Desired hygroscopic salts properties that cannot be fully satisfied by a single hygroscopic salt\\cite{Ahmed1998}.\n	The vapor pressure difference between the air and the desiccant is the mass transfer (moisture transfer) driving force, which makes desiccant to absorb the moisture or deliver the moisture to the air\\cite{Liu2009}.\n		\\begin{itemize}

contacting the concentrated solution in the dehumidifier\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n		and the diluted solution from the dehumidifier will come to the regenerator to be re-concentrated. Low grade heat can be utilized to regenerate the desiccants, such as solar energy or waste heat\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n		The dehumidifier is one of the key components in liquid desiccant air- conditioning systems, which can be divided into adiabatic type and internally cooled type according to the fact whether it has extra cooling fluid or not\\cite{Liu2009}.\n			\\begin{itemize} \\itemsep0pt\\parskip0pt \\parsep0pt\n				\\item [$\\bullet$]In the adiabatic dehumidifier, only air and desiccant these two fluids exchange heat and mass (moisture content).\\cite{Liu2009}.\n				\\item [$\\bullet$]Extra cooling fluid is introduced to cool the desiccant in the internally cooled dehumidifier, which can be cooling water, cooling air\\cite{Liu2009}.\n				\\item [$\\bullet$]The internally cooled dehumidifier may have better mass transfer performance than the adiabatic type [3], since the desiccant is cooled synchronously, and thus maintain the desiccant low surface vapor pressure, as it contacts the humid air\\cite{Liu2009}.\n			\\end{itemize}\n		The desiccant directly contacts the humid air in the internally cooled dehumidifier, and the heat and mass transfer processes occur between the desiccant and the air. The desiccant is cooled synchronously through indirectly contacting with the cooling fluid. Since the heat and mass transfer theoretical model is about the same for different flow patterns\\cite{Liu2009}.\n		\\paragraph{System Advantages}\n		 the similar flow-pattern dehumidifiers are tested, in which the flow direction of air to desiccant is counter- flow and the flow direction of cooling fluid to desiccant is cross- flow\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n		 Lowenstein et al experimentally tests the performance of a kind of cross-flow dehumidifier, in which the cooling water is in parallel-flow to the desiccant\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n		 Khan establishes the heat and mass transfer model of an internally cooled dehumidifier, in which air is in cross-flow to the desiccant and the cooling water (or refrigerant) is also in cross-flow to the desiccant. Several important parameters which strongly influenced the dehumidifier performance are identified based on the numerically solved two- dimensional steady state model. One-dimensional difference equations are used by Ren et al. to describe the heat and mass transfer performance in the internally cooled dehumidifier with parallel/counter-flow configurations\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n		 However, in the internally cooled dehumidifier, the mass flow rate ratio of air to desiccant is about one order of magnitude larger. The mass transfer driving force distributions in the internally cooled dehumidifier at parallel-flow and counter-flow configurations\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n		 the mass transfer performance of the counter-flow configuration (Types B1 and B2) is the best, and the parallel-flow configuration (Type A) is the worst, and cross-flow configuration (Types C1, C2 and C3) is among the counter-flow and parallel-flow types within the same operating conditions\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n		 For the internally cooled dehumidifier, counter-flow config- uration (flow direction of air to desiccant) has the best dehumidification performance, parallel-flow configuration is the poorest, and the performance of cross-flow configuration is among the counter-flow and parallel-flow configurations at the same operating conditions\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n		 desiccant concentration for the internally cooled dehumidifier, and the desiccant temperature for the adiabatic dehumidifier. Less desiccant flow rate can be adopted in the internally cooled dehumidifier, which is about an order of magnitude less than that in the adiabatic dehumidifier\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n		 Internally cooled dehumidifier has better mass transfer performance compared with adiabatic dehumidifier plus external heat exchanger, due to less heat transfer process and less desiccant mixing loss in the internally cooled dehumidifier\\cite{Liu2009}.\\\\\n\n\\cite{}\n\\setcounter{section}{\\value{resetsection}} %reset section numbering using value of resetcounter\n\\cleardoublepage",
